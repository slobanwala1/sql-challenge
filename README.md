### Links to files

I've attached links to the files as I've organized them into the sections they were given us to work on. The first portion was *Data Modeling*. The link to that directory is: [Data Modeling](https://github.com/slobanwala1/python-api-challenge/blob/main/my_submission/starter_code/WeatherPy.ipynb). The other is called [VacationPy](https://github.com/slobanwala1/python-api-challenge/blob/main/my_submission/starter_code/VacationPy.ipynb). The Images are located in [my_submission/Images/output_data](https://github.com/slobanwala1/python-api-challenge/tree/main/my_submission/Images/output_data).
