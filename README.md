The second portion is *Data Engineering* and heres the link: [Data Engineering](https://github.com/slobanwala1/sql-challenge/tree/main/my_submission/Data_Engineering). The third portion is *Data Analysis* and is located at: [Data Analysis](https://github.com/slobanwala1/sql-challenge/tree/main/my_submission/Data_Analysis). Finally the fun portion to see the data in a visual form was in the *Bonus* portion. That is located at: [Bonus](https://github.com/slobanwala1/sql-challenge/tree/main/my_submission/Bonus).
